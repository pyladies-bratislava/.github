# Pyladies Bratislava

We are the Bratislava chapter of [Pyladies](https://pyladies.com). We meet once a month and have fun with Python.

In our github you can find the following repos:

1. meetups: this is where we store code, presentation and other files that we used/made in our meetups
2. website: this is the frontend of [our website](https://bratislava.pyladies.com). It is a react app.
3. flask-backend: this is the backend of [our website](https://bratislava.pyladies.com). It is a flask app. There is also a FastAPI skeleton that we plan to use as well.
